### Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/MarcusMadland/bgfx-starter.git
```

Run `generate-project-win.bat` and `compile-shaders-win`. 

Open `project.sln` in Visual Studio. `project/src/projectlayer.cpp` contains the pipeline code that's running. Everything should run out of the box fine. Let me know if there are any issues.
